## Steps to create a new component

### Create a basic component - Definition & its dialog properties


1. In this document we would like to show you how to create a custom block component named text-image.
2. One can use this as an example to create more blocks.
3. Fistly define the block on the Component-definition.json
```json
   
   {
          "title": "Text-Image",
          "id": "text-image",
          "plugins": {
            "xwalk": {
              "page": {
                "resourceType": "core/franklin/components/block/v1/block",
                "template": {
                  "name": "text-image",
                  "model": "text-image"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
   ```
4. Note that the resource type should be `core/franklin/components/block/v1/block`
5. Next step is to define the component properties in the component-models.json
6. The code to include for image text component is as below
```json
   {
    "id": "text-image",
    "fields": [
      {
        "component": "reference",
        "valueType": "string",
        "name": "image",
        "label": "Image",
        "multi": false
      },
      {
        "component": "text-input",
        "valueType": "string",
        "name": "imageAlt",
        "label": "Alt text",
        "value": ""
      },
      {
        "component": "text-area",
        "name": "text",
        "value": "",
        "label": "Text",
        "valueType": "string"
      },
      {
        "component": "select",
        "name": "imagePosition",
        "filter": "imagePosition",
        "value": "",
        "label": "Image Position",
        "valueType": "string",
        "options": [
          {
            "name": "Left",
            "value": "left"
          },
          {
            "name": "Right",
            "value": "right"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
   } 
   ```
7. The next step is to add it in a filter (It is a place where we define the group wher the component appears)
```json
  {
    "id": "section",
    "components": [
      "text",
      "image",
      "button",
      "title",
      "hero",
      "cards",
      "columns",
      "text-image"
    ]
  }
   ```

### Component styles & scripts
The Component styles & scripts can be defined in the blocks section (within the blocks folder)
eg. a new folder named "text-image" has been created to hold the 2 files 
* [text-image.css](https://github.com/Harish-deva/x-walk/blob/main/blocks/text-image/text-image.css)
* [text-image.js](https://github.com/Harish-deva/x-walk/blob/main/blocks/text-image/text-image.js)

Post making all the changes the outcome can be seen like this, 
Text Image component with left aligned image 
![](../resources/text-image-left.png)

Text Image component with right aligned image
![](../resources/text-image-right.png)

Kindly refer the [examples](https://github.com/adobe-experience-league/exlm/tree/56a35accfd904e3636b42262e50f0f508683fd47/blocks) from Adobe that has quite a lot of component examples. 

### Types of components

1. Blocks (Content based components - image , text , buttons etc.)
2. Section (Similar to container)
